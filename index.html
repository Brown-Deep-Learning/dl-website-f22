                        <p>
                            Over the past few years, Deep Learning has become a popular area,
                            with deep neural network methods obtaining state-of-the-art results on applications in
                            computer vision (Self-Driving Cars), natural language processing (Google Translate), and
                            reinforcement learning (AlphaGo).
                            These technologies are having transformative effects on our society, including some
                            undesirable ones (e.g. deep fakes).
                        </p><p>
                            This course is there to give students a practical understanding of how Deep Learning works,
                            how to implement neural networks, and how to apply them ethically. 
                            We introduce students to the core concepts of deep neural networks 
                            and survey the techniques used to model complex processes within the contexts of
                            computer vision and natural language processing.  
                        </p><p>
                            Throughout the course, we emphasize and require students to think
                            critically about potential ethical pitfalls that can result
                            from mis-application of these powerful models. The course is taught using the Tensorflow
                            deep learning framework.

                        </p>

                            Exceptions may be possible for those missing one of these prerequisites if (a) the student has
                            taken
                            another course which covers similar material, or if (b) the student will be concurrently taking
                            the prerequisite.
                            If either of these situations applies to you, use the “Request Override” feature in
                            Courses@Brown to
                            request an override code (and explain why you believe your situation merits one).

                                algorithmic conceptual questions as well as an open-ended ethics question that requires
                                students to reflect on societal ramifications of the machine learning models they are

                                You will have four (4) free late days to use towards all but the last project. These late
                                days can be used on code or conceptual assignments. After your late days are expended you
                                will lose 10% of your project grade for each extra day your handin is
                                delayed. At the end of the term, we will calculate how to best divvy out your late days to
                                best help your final grade. There is no need for you to do anything special for this, other
                                than keep track of submission dates for your own records. Note that because we do this,

                                    that result in exceptions to this late policy. All such circumstances require an official
                                    note from the Deans. In general, they only provide support notes on behalf of students who
                                    are experiencing disruptive medical or personal circumstances, including those related to
                                    Title IX situations, that
                                    affect their ability to do academic work in a timely way. If you believe an extension is
                                    warranted for you, and you have a note from the Deans, please notify the instructor. What

                                Students will attend one two hour-long weekly lab slot assigned to them. It is expected that
                                students
                                should be able to complete the exercises for a given lab, and get them checked off by the
                                lab TA,
                                during this assigned slot. Lab materials for each week will be released online at the
                                beginning of
                                the week; students are welcome to look at and beginning working on the lab in advance of
                                their lab
                                slot, if they wish. If the student does not complete the lab and/or get it checked off
                                during their
                                slot, they can go to another lab section that week to get it checked off (without penalty).
                                If a student misses their assigned lab slot, they can also go to another lab section to get
                                the lab
                                checked off. However, this will incur a lab grade penalty (e.g. a 3/4 instead of a 4/4 for
                                that lab).
                                Students will be permitted to miss their assigned lab slot three (3) times without incurring
                                this penalty.
                                In all cases, a lab must be checked off at latest by the student’s assigned lab slot the
                                following week.
                                If a student knows well in advance that they will not be able to make their assigned lab
                                slot but
                                will be able to make another slot that week, the student may message their lab TA at least
                                48
                                hours in advance to be temporarily switched into a different lab slot for that week. This
                                will not
                                incur a late lab penalty.

                                All students will be required to complete a final project in groups of 2-3. At minimum, this
                                should entail re-implementing the methods described by a recent deep learning research
                                paper. The course staff will provide resources to help students find and select appropriate
                                papers for their projects.
                                Expectations are higher for 2470 students and 1470 capstone students: they will be required
                                to go above-and-beyond re-implementing an existing research paper, and will be required to
                                attempt a novel research project. This could involve investigating a new model architecture
                                to solve an existing problem, adapting methodology from a different problem to solve an
                                existing problem, or defining and solving a new problem of interest.

                                Differences Between 1470 and 2470?
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Both sections of this course share the same course staff, lectures, labs, and assignments.
                                1470 is open to everyone who meets the prerequisites. 2470 is a graduate-level course and is
                                intended for
                                graduate students; registration is gated accordingly. The instructor reserves the right to
                                admit
                                undergraduates into 2470 at her discretion.

                            </p>
                            In terms of required coursework, the two sections have the following differences:
                            <p><b>Assignments (Programming):</b> Every programming assignment has a quantitative metric
                                threshold that all students’ code is expected to meet (e.g. test-set accuracy). The
                                threshold for 2470 students is higher. Reaching this higher threshold may require more
                                advanced model architectures,
                                the implementation of which may require reading additional reference material.</p>

                            <p><b>Assignments (Written):</b> 2470 students will be required to answer additional written
                                questions. These may be mathematical (e.g. proving/deriving some property of a
                                model/algorithm) or conceptual in nature (e.g. requiring reading a related paper and
                                connecting its findings to what we have discussed in class).
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Final Project:</b> 2470 students will be required to go above-and-beyond re-implementing
                                an existing research paper: rather, they will be required to attempt a novel research
                                project. This could
                                involve investigating a new model architecture to solve an existing problem, adapting
                                methodology from a different problem to solve an existing problem, or defining and solving a
                                new problem of
                                interest.</p>

                                Programming:
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                All programming in this course will be done in Python, primarily using numpy and the Python
                                Tensorflow API. Labs will be provided as Google Collab notebooks.

                                Since this is not a software engineering course, we won’t be enforcing stringent style
                                guidelines, but you should write so that someone who isn’t a Python wizard will be able to
                                understand what your program is doing (add plenty of comments, break up code into smaller
                                functions, i.e. apply basic common sense). If you turn in a partially-functional assignment
                                and we can’t tell what you were trying to do, we’ll probably be very grumpy about giving
                                partial credit.

                                As that translates to an official policy, so long as your code produces the expected
                                output(s) and adheres to any specific project restrictions (runtime, etc.) then you will not
                                lose points for poor design or coding practices. <i>However</i>, as this is not a software
                                design course, it is not the responsibility of the TAs to attempt to understand the
                                intentions underlying confusing code. If it is not fully clear what you were trying to do in
                                the
                                implementation of a partially-functional assignment (i.e. not all of the output is as
                                expected) then partial-credit will be given sparingly and at our discretion.

                                the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are
                                reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Brown Academic and Student
                                Conduct Codes.

                                Discussion of course material with your classmates is both permitted and encouraged.
                                However, <b>showing, copying, or other sharing of actual code or verbatim answers to written
                                    questions is forbidden</b>. This includes publishing projects on Github or any other
                                public platform. This policy <b>will be</b> enforced.

                                One of the ways that we enforce the collaboration policy is by running MOSS on all code
                                submissions. For those who are new to the department or otherwise unfamiliar with it, MOSS
                                (short for "measure of software similarity") is a software tool which detects similarities
                                between pieces of code. The course staff manually examines the output of MOSS to look for
                                cases where two students’ submitted code is similar in such a way that it is sufficiently
                                unlikely for them to have independently produced it (i.e., an instance of cheating or code
                                plagiarism).
                            </p>

                            <b>Regret clause:</b> We recognize that college is stressful, and sometimes that stress leads to
                            panicked,
                            bad decision making near deadlines. We are also aware that this problem is likely to be
                            exacerbated
                            by the unusually stressful period of history through which we are all living right now. In the
                            spirit of this understanding, we are implementing a "regret clause" for the course this year. If
                            a student
                            submits an assignment that they know to contain plagiarized material (either code or answers to
                            written questions), that student may invoke the regret clause by informing the instructor of the
                            plagiarized material within 48 hours of the assignment submission deadline. The instructor will
                            ask to meet with the student, and the outcome of this meeting can vary. On a first invocation of
                            the regret clause, the instructor will exercise her discretion, applying a penalty up to
                            receiving zero credit on the plagiarized portion of the assignment. On subsequent invocations,
                            all plagiarized
                            portions of the assignment will automatically receive zero credit. In all cases, the occurrence
                            of plagiarism will be kept confidential by the instructor.

                            <p>If the course staff detects a plagiarized submission, and the student has not invoked the
                                regret clause, then we will write up a formal plagiarism case to be heard by the Academic
                                Code Committee. These hearings can result in a variety of outcomes, including immediately
                                failing the course and receiving
                                a “Directed NC” (i.e. a form of NC that does show up on your transcript, along with a note
                                that the NC was given for an academic code violation).</p>

                                CSCI 1470/2470 is now offered in the Fall and Spring semesters with similar course content. Therefore, starting this academic year, we are introducing a strict INC policy for the course. The instructor will allow only students with roughly 30% of the course requirements remaining to opt for INC grade at the end of the semester. The exact 30% requirement can be determined by discussing it with the instructor. For example, if there are 5 assignments and the student completed 3 full assignments and 1 partial assignment. Similarly, if there are 8 labs, the student has 2-3 required labs that are not checked off. If a student chooses the INC option, the remaining work must be completed within 1 month of the end of the course.
