                    As Blueno travels through deep space, he decides to make
                    good use of the travel time to finally learn to distinguish
                    the furry, four-legged creatures he often sees walking
                    around. However, Blueno thinks he might need a little help.
                    He&#39;s travelling alone, so we won&#39;t be there to help
                    him, but we can help him in a different way. We decide to
                    build a model that he can access on his spaceship to
                    hopefully aid him in learning to recognize cats vs. dogs.

                    In this assignment, you will be building a Convolutional
                    Neural Network (CNN) with pooling layers using the CIFAR
                    dataset to learn to distinguish cats and dogs.

                    From homework 2 onward, we will no longer use
                    Gradescope&#39;s online assignment feature for conceptual
                    questions (which was used in hw1); instead we will do pdf
                    submissions to Gradescope. Please submit your pdf with answers
                    to all conceptual questions as one pdf on Gradescope under 
                    HW2 Conceptual Questions: CIFAR2: Convolutional Neural Networks. 
                    When submitting the pdf to Gradescope, be sure to select in Gradescope 
                    which pages match with which questions. LaTex is recommended but not required.

                    2470 students only: If you are in 2470, all conceptual
                    questions (including non-2470 ones) should be written as one
                    pdf and submitted to the &quot;[CS2470] Hw2 Conceptual
                    Questions: Convolution Neural Networks&quot; assignment. <strong>Do
                    not submit also to the CS1470 conceptual assignment.</strong>

                    There are two bash scripts in the root directory of the hw
                    repository, <code>create_venv.sh</code> for creating a
                    virtual environment and <code>download.sh</code> for
                    downloading the data (if it exists for that homework). You
                    need to run <code>download.sh</code> to get the data.
                    However, if you created a virtual environment for the last
                    homework or you&#39;re working on the department machine
                    from <code>ssh</code>, you do not need to run
                    <code>create_venv.sh</code> (you will still need to activate
                    the virtualenv you created in hw1 by running
                    <code>source &lt;path to virtual env&gt;/bin/activate</code
                    >, e.g. if your virtualenv created in hw1 is located at
                    <code>/User/blueno/cs1470/hw1/env</code>, you need to
                    activate the virtualenv with
                    <code>source /User/blueno/cs1470/hw1/env/bin/activate</code
                    >.) You can run a bash script with the command
                    <code>./script_name.sh</code> (ex:
                    <code>./download.sh</code>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stencil should contain these files: assignment.py,
                    convolution.py and preprocess.py.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work on this assignment off of the stencil code provided,
                    but
                    <strong
                        >do not change the stencil except where
                        specified.</strong
                    >
                    Changing the stencil will result in incompatiblity with the
                    autograder and result in a low grade. You shouldn&#39;t
                    change any method signatures or add any trainable parameters
                    to <strong>init</strong> that we don&#39;t give you (other
                    instance variables are fine).

                    <strong
                        >This assignment should take longer to run than the
                        previous assignment. If completed correctly, the model
                        should train and test within 15 minutes on a department
                        machine.</strong

                    While you will mainly be using TensorFlow functions, the
                    second part of the assignment requires you to write your own
                    convolution function, which is very computationally
                    expensive. To counter this, we only require that you print
                    the accuracy across the test set after finishing all
                    training. On a department machine, training should take
                    about 3 minutes and testing using your own convolution
                    should take about 2 minutes. While writing your code locally
                    may be easier, we recommend running your code on department
                    machines to avoid straining your personal computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This assignment requires the TensorFlow, NumPy, and
                    Matplotlib packages. These should all be installed already
                    in the virtualenv we provide, and you should be good to go
                    as long as you&#39;ve activated it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To activate the virtual environment on a department machine,
                    you can run:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">source</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">/course/</span>cs1470<span class="hljs-regexp">/tf-2.3/</span>bin<span class="hljs-regexp">/activate</span>
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You can also check out the Python virtual environment guide
                    to set up TensorFlow 2.3 on your local machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note again that if you installed a virtual
                    environment onto your local machine
                    <strong
                        >you do not need to use create_venv.sh to install the
                        virtual environment again</strong
                    >. The environment you created previously will work for this
                    assignment as well. See previous section (Setup) for how to
                    activate that hw1 environment.

                <h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Your task is a binary classification rather than multi-class
                    classification problem. We are doing
                    <strong>CIFAR2, not CIFAR10</strong>. While the CIFAR10
                    dataset has 10 possible classes (airplane, automobile, bird,
                    cat, deer, frog, horse, ship, and truck), you will build a
                    CNN to take in an image and correctly predict its class to
                    either be a cat or dog, hence CIFAR2. We limit this
                    assignment to a binary classification problem so that you
                    can train the model in a reasonable amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>The assignment has <strong>three parts</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Conceptual Questions:</strong> Answer questions
                        related to the assignment and class material on
                        Gradescope. If you are taking 2470, you must also answer
                        the additional questions on Gradescope marked with
                        CS2470.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Model:</strong> Build the model. Our stencil
                        provides a model class with several methods and
                        hyperparameters you need to use for your network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Convolution Function</strong> Fill out a
                        function that performs the convolution operator. See
                        Roadmap below for more information on parts 2 and 3.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You should include a brief README with your model&#39;s
                    accuracy and any known bugs.
                </p>
                <h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
                <p>
                    You will notice that the structure of the Model class is
                    very similar to the Model class defined in your first
                    assignment.
                    <strong
                        >We strongly suggest that you first complete the Intro
                        to TensorFlow Lab before starting this
                        assignment.</strong
                    >
                    The lab includes many explanations about the way a Model
                    class is structured, what variables are, and how things work
                    in TensorFlow. If you come into hours with questions about
                    TensorFlow related material that is covered in the lab, we
                    will direct you to the lab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is a brief outline of some things you should do. We
                    expect you to fill in some of the missing gaps (review

                    Step 1. Preprocess the data
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have provided you with a function
                        <code>unpickle(file)</code> in the preprocess file
                        stencil, which unpickles an object and returns a
                        dictionary. <strong>Do not edit it</strong>. We have also already
                        extracted the inputs and labels from the dictionary in 
                        <code>get_data</code> so you have no need to deal with
                        the pickled file or the dictionary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will want to limit the inputs and labels returned by
                        <code>get_data</code> to those representing the first
                        and second classes of your choice. For every image and
                        its corresponding label, if the label is not of the
                        first or second class, then remove the image and label
                        from your inputs and labels arrays. You might find
                        <code>numpy.nonzero</code>[<a
                            href="https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.nonzero.html"
                            >https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.nonzero.html</a
                        >] useful for finding only the indices of your labels
                        which correspond to the first and second class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At this point, your inputs are still two dimensional.
                        You will want to reshape your inputs into (-1, 3, 32,
                        32) using
                        <code>tf.reshape(inputs, (-1, 3, 32 ,32))</code> and
                        then transpose them using
                        <code>tf.transpose(inputs, perm=[0,2,3,1])</code> so
                        that the final inputs you return have shape
                        (num_examples, 32, 32, 3), where the width is 32, height
                        is 32, and number of channels is 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You now have inputs and labels of only two classes, but
                        the label numbers do not represent the binary inputs.
                        You will want to re-number the labels such that the cat label class is 0 
                        and the dog label is 1 (for your own training purposes, it doesn't matter which is which; 
                        however, we require this specificity for our autograder). You might find
                        <code>numpy.where</code> [<a
                            href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html"
                            >https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html</a
                        >] useful in the renumbering process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After doing that, you will want to turn your labels into
                        one hot vectors, where the index with a 1 represents the
                        class of the correct image. You can do this with the
                        function <code>tf.one_hot</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This can be a bit confusing so we&#39;ll just make it
                        clear:
                        <strong
                            >your labels should be of size (num_images,
                            num_classes).</strong
                        >
                        So for example, if your first class is a cat and your
                        second class is sushi, the corresponding label of the
                        first image might be [0, 1] where a 1 in the second
                        index means that it&#39;s sushi.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <em>Note:</em> You should normalize the input pixel values
                    so that they range from 0 to 1 to avoid any numerical
                    overflow issues. This can be done by dividing each pixel
                    value by 255.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You&#39;re going to be calling get_data on both the training
                    and testing data files in <code>assignment.py</code>. The
                    testing and training data files to be read in are in the
                    following format:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>train</code>: A pickled object of 50,000 train
                        images and labels. This includes images and labels of
                        all 10 classes. After unpickling the file, the
                        dictionary will have the following elements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                data -- a 50000x3072 numpy array of uint8s. Each
                                row of the array stores a 32x32 color image. The
                                first 1024 entries contain the red channel
                                values, the next 1024 the green, and the final
                                1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major
                                order, so that the first 32 entries of the array
                                are the red channel values of the first row of
                                the image.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                labels -- a list of 50000 numbers in the range
                                0-9. The number at index i indicates the label
                                of the ith image in the array data.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        images and labels. This includes images and labels of
                        all 10 classes. Unpickling the file gives a dictionary
                        with the same key values as above.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <em>Note</em> If you download the dataset from online, the
                    training data is actually divided into batches. We have done
                    the job of repickling all of the batches into one single
                    train file for your ease.

                        is still necessary for the autograder. Consider
                        what&#39;s being learned in a CNN and intialize those as
                        trainable parameters. In the last assignment, it was our
                        weights and biases. This time around, you will still
                        want weights and biases, but there are other things that

                        In the main function, you will want to get your train
                        and test data, initialize your model, and train it for
                        many epochs. We suggest training for 10 epochs. For the
                        autograder, we will train it for at most 25 epochs (hard
                        limit of 15 minutes). We have provided for you a train
                        and test method to fill out. The train method will take
                        in the model and do the forward and backward pass for
                        <strong>a SINGLE epoch</strong>. Yes, this means that,
                        unlike the first assignment, your
                        <code>main</code> function will have a for loop that
                        goes through the number of epochs, calling train each
                        time.

                        Even though this is technically part of preprocessing,
                        you should shuffle your inputs and labels when TRAINING.
                        Keep in mind that they have to be shuffled in the same
                        order. We suggest creating a range of indices of length
                        num_examples, then using <code>tf.random.shuffle</code>.
                        Finally you can use
                        <code>tf.gather(train_inputs, indices)</code> to shuffle
                        your inputs. You can do the same with your labels to
                        ensure they are shuffled the same way.

                        When training, you might find it helpful to actually

                        your batch of image inputs to increase accuracy.

                        Call the model&#39;s forward pass and calculate the loss
                        within the scope of <code>tf.GradientTape</code>. Then
                        use the model&#39;s optimizer to apply the gradients to
                        your model&#39;s trainable variables outside of the

                        please refer to the lab. This is synonymous with doing
                        the <code>gradient_descent</code> function in the first

                        If you&#39;d like, you can calculate the train accuracy
                        to check that your model does not overfit the training
                        set. If you get upwards of 80% accuracy on the training
                        set but only 65% accuracy on the testing set, you might
                        be overfitting.

                    For the sake of simple math calculations (less is more,
                    no?), we&#39;ll require that our
                    <code>conv2d</code> function
                    <strong>only works with a stride of 1</strong> (for both
                    width and height). This is because the calculation for
                    padding size changes as a result of the stride, which would
                    be way more complex and unreasonable for a second
                    assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do <strong>NOT</strong> change the parameters of the conv2d
                    function we have provided. Even though the
                    <code>conv2d</code> function takes in a strides argument,
                    you should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> pass in [1, 1, 1, 1].
                    Leaving in strides as an argument was a conscious design
                    choice - if you wanted to eventually make the conv2d
                    function work for other kinds of strides in your own time,
                    this would allow you to easily change it.

                    <li>
                        Your inputs will have 4 dimensions. If we are to use
                        this <code>conv2d</code> function for the first layer,
                        the inputs would be [batch_size, in_height, in_width,
                        input_channels].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should ensure that the input&#39;s number of
                        &quot;in channels&quot; is equivalent to the
                        filters&#39; number of &quot;in channels&quot;. Make
                        sure to add an assert statement or throw an error if the
                        number of input in channels are not the same as the
                        filters in channels. You will lose points if you do not
                        do this.

                    <li>
                        When calculating how much padding to use for SAME
                        padding, padding is just
                        <code>(filter_size - 1)/2</code> if you are using
                        strides of 1. The calculation of padding differs if you
                        increase your strides and is much more complex, so we
                        won’t be dealing with that. If you are interested, you
                        may read about it
                        <a

                            >here</a
                        >. If padding is not an integer, you can just round down
                        using <code>math.floor</code>.

                    <li>
                        You can use this hefty NumPy function
                        <code>np.pad</code> to pad your input!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After padding (if needed), you will want to go through
                        the entire batch of images and perform the convolution
                        operator on each image. There are two ways of going
                        about this - you can continuously append to multi
                        dimensional NumPy arrays to an output array or you can
                        create a NumPy array with the correct output dimensions,
                        and just update each element in the output as you
                        perform the convolution operator. We suggest doing the
                        latter - it&#39;s conceptually easier to keep track of
                        things this way.

                            1</code
                        >. Again, <code>strideX</code> and

                        You will want to iterate the entire height and width
                        including padding, stopping when you cannot fit a filter
                        over the rest of the padding input. For convolution with
                        many input channels, you will want to perform the
                        convolution per input channel and sum those dot products
                        together.

                        TensorFlow cannot build a graph/differentiate with NumPy

                        <code>is_testing</code> is True, you use your own
                        convolution rather than TensorFlow&#39;s
                        <code>conv2d</code> on a
                        <strong>SINGLE</strong> convolution layer. If you follow
                        the architecture described above, we suggest adding in
                        an if statement before the third convolution layer (ie.
                        switch out the <code>conv2d</code> for your third
                        convolution). This part will take the longest, and is
                        why we say it might actually take up to 15 minutes on a

                        method for you to visualize your predictions against the
                        true labels using matplotlib, a useful Python library
                        for plotting graphs. This method is currently written
                        with the image_labels having a shape of (num_images,
                        num_classes).
                        <strong><em>DO NOT EDIT THIS FUNCTION.</em></strong> You
                        should call this function after training and testing,
                        passing into into <code>visualize_results</code> an
                        input of 50 images, 50 probabilities, 50 labels, the
                        first label name, and second label name.

                        the strings of the first and second classes. A
                        <code>visualize_results</code> method call might look
                        like:

                            >visualize_results(image_inputs, logits,

                        This should result in two visuals, one for correct
                        predictions, and one for incorrect predictions. You
                        should do this after you are sure you have met the
                        benchmark for test accuracy.

                        visualize your loss per batch over time. Your model or
                        your training function should have a list
                        <code>loss_list</code> to which you can append batch
                        losses to during training. You should call this function
