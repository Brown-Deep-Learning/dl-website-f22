                Dat boi Blueno has just arrived at a new planet in outer
                space, but is having trouble understanding the number
                system. It seems this planet uses a different number system.
                Blueno wonders: are numbers not just social constructs used
                to limit and ensure social order? Why do these planet
                inhabitants subject themselves to this straightjacket of
                numbers - from number of swipes on Tunder to deadlines,
                numbers only exist to enforce put people in place. Blueno
                wants to learn more about this number system but don&#39;t
                know how to recognize any digits. Even worse, Blueno has
                gone on a few dates but can&#39;t pay for the meal when the
                bill comes! Those poor dates...Blueno needs YOUR help to
                build a classifier that can recognize digits!
            </p>
            <p>
                In this assignment, you will be coding a single-layer neural
                network to classify handwritten digits using only
                <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html">NumPy</a>. You will not be using
                TensorFlow, or any other deep
                learning framework, for this assignment.
                <strong><em>Please read this handout in its entirety before
                        beginning the assignment.</em></strong>

                for more information about GitHub and GitHub Classroom.
            <h3>Getting the Data</h3>
            There are two bash scripts in the root directory of the hw
            repository, <code>create_venv.sh</code> for creating a
            virtual environment and <code>download.sh</code> for
            downloading the data (if it exists for that homework). You
            need to run <code>download.sh</code> to get the data.
            <br />
            <h3>Using the Virtualenv</h3>
            If you want to develop locally, you can run
            <code>create_venv.sh</code> from the root directory. You can run a bash script with the command
            <code>./script_name.sh</code> (ex:
            <code> bash ./download.sh</code>) Please reference this
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16kkj9O2JnMFhIbHF6iZpCseloBduDSVT-B-U9R8WKcA/edit?usp=sharing">guide
                for more info on the virtual environment.</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            If you want to develop on a department machine via ssh, you should ssh into a department
            machine and use our course’s public virtual environment. Please look below for more info.

                Work on this assignment off of the stencil code provided,
                but
                <strong>do not change the stencil except where
                    specified.</strong>
                Changing the stencil will result in incompatiblity with the
                autograder and result in a low grade. You shouldn&#39;t
                change any method signatures or add any trainable parameters
                to <strong>init</strong> that we don&#39;t give you (other
                instance variables are fine).
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure that you are using Python version 3.7 on this
                assignment and all future assignments. You can check this in
                the terminal with:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">python</span> --<span class="hljs-keyword">version</span>
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Most department machines should have Python 3.7. Please see
                the installing TensorFlow document for installing Python 3.7
                on your local machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment also requires the NumPy and Matplotlib
                packages. You can install them using pip or run the
                assignment in a virtual environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run the virtual environment on a department machine, you
                can run:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">source</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">/course/</span>cs1470<span class="hljs-regexp">/tf-2.3/</span>bin<span class="hljs-regexp">/activate</span>

            <p>
                This task is a multi-classification problem. You will build
                a one layer neural network to take an image of a handwritten
                digit and predict its class.
            </p>
            <p>The assignment has <strong>2 parts</strong>.</p>
            <p>
                Our stencil provides a model class with several methods and
                hyperparameters you need to use for your network. You will
                also answer questions related to the assignment and class
                material. If you are taking 2470, you must also submit
                another file with your answers to the additional questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should include a brief README with your model&#39;s
                accuracy and any known bugs.
            </p>
            <h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment, we&#39;ll walk you through the pipeline
                of training a neural net, including the structure of the
                model class and the methods you will have to fill in.
            </p>
            <h3 id="step-1-preprocess-the-data">
                Step 1. Preprocess the data
            </h3>
            <p>
                Before training a network, you will need to clean your data.
                This includes retrieving the data, altering the data, and
                formatting them into the inputs for your network. For this
                assignment, you will be working on the MNIST dataset. The
                dataset can be found here:
                <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ </a>, but we have also
                provided it to you within the ZIP file.
            </p>
            <p>
                The training data contains 60,000 examples broken into two
                files: one file contains the image pixel data and the other
                contains the class label.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should train your network using
                <strong>only</strong> the training data and then test your
                network&#39;s accuracy on the testing data. Your program
                should print its accuracy over the test dataset upon
                completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MNIST data files are gzipped. You can use the
                <code>gzip</code> library to read these files from Python.
                To open a gzipped file from Python you can use the following
                code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-python">import gzip
            <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'file.gz'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'rb'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f, gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> bytestream:
              <span class="hljs-comment"># bytestream contains the data of the fileobj</span>
              <span class="hljs-comment"># You can use bytestream.read(n) to read n bytes from the file.</span>
              <span class="hljs-comment"># If you use bytestream.read(n) twice, </span>
              <span class="hljs-comment"># the first call reads the first n bytes, the second reads the second n bytes</span>
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You might find the function
                <code>numpy.frombuffer</code> (<a
                    href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.frombuffer.html">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.frombuffer.html</a>)
                helpful to convert from a buffer of bytes to a NumPy
                array. You should normalize the pixel values so that they
                range from 0 to 1 This can be done by dividing each pixel
                value by 255 to avoid any numerical overflow issues. Each
                pixel is exactly 1 byte.
            </p>
            <p>
                The testing and training data are in the following format:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <code>train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz</code>: 16 byte
                        header, which you should read in and ignore,
                        followed by 60,000 training images. A training
                        example consists of 784
                        <em>single-byte</em> integers (from 0-255) which
                        represent pixel intensities. You will want to read
                        the 16 byte header and then save the rest of the
                        data as the actual training inputs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <code>train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz</code>: 8 byte
                        header, which you should read in and ignore,
                        followed by 60,000 training labels. A training label
                        consists of <em>single-byte</em> integers from 0-9
                        representing the class label. You will want to read
                        the 8 byte header and then save the rest of the data
                        as the actual training labels.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <code>t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz</code>: 16 byte
                        header, which you should read in and ignore,
                        followed by 10,000 testing images. You will want to
                        read the 16 byte header and then save the rest of
                        the data as the actual testing inputs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <code>t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz</code>: 8 byte
                        header, which you should read in and ignore,
                        followed by 10,000 testing labels. You will want to
                        read the 8 byte header and then save the rest of the
                        data as the actual training labels.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <em>Note</em>: You can use the data type
                <code>np.uint8</code> for single-byte (or 8-bit) integers.
                You may have to convert to <code>np.float32</code> when
                preprocessing to normalize the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                You want the inputs for your model to be batch size of
                images. Each image is a 28 by 28 matrix of pixel values, but
                you will have to &quot;flatten&quot; each image into a
                vector of pixel values of length 784. You might find
                <code>numpy.reshape</code>[<a
                    href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html</a>]
                to helpful in this process.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will be loading in the dataset in preprocess.py in
                    the function get_data(inputs_file_path,
                    labels_file_path, num_examples)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You may also find it helpful in preprocessing to create a helper
                function for batching, which returns a slice of data and a slice
                of labels, given a starting index for the slice and the batch size.
                These two slices represent a batch of data and a batch of labels.
                Note: this function isn't required for you to create/implement.
                If you can think of another place or way to batch the data,
                feel free to do it as you like it!

            <h3 id="step-2-fill-in-the-model">Step 2. Fill in the Model</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your next step should be to fill out the methods in
                        the model, including all of the TODOs listed in
                        assignment.py. This entails setting your
                        hyperparameters and trainable parameters within the
                        constructor of the model class, filling out the call
                        function (forward pass), calculating the loss, doing
                        back propogation, and writing a function to
                        calculate your model&#39;s accuracy.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Now it&#39;s time to fill out the Model class! You
                        should initialize all hyperparameters and trainable
                        parameters in the constructor of the class.
                        Hyperparameters are typically not members of the
                        model class, but doing this is necessary so that
                        when we run your model, we use the exact same
                        hyperparameters you did. Trainable parameters are
                        modified through and through the entirety of
                        training the model (that&#39;s what the model is
                        learning!) so it makes sense to initialize this in
                        the Model class.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For your hyperparameters, we suggest you train all
                    training examples with a learning rate of $\lambda =
                    0.5$. For your batch size, we recommend using 100.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should initialize a total of 7850 trainable
                    parameters. These are the weights $w_{i, j}$
                    and the biases $b_{j}$ where $0 \leq i \leq 783$ and $0
                    \leq j \leq 9$. All parameters should be initialized to
                    0.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, you should fill in the Model&#39;s
                    <code>call</code> function, returning the softmax
                    probabilities for each digit for each image in the
                    batch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>loss</code> function should implement the
                    cross-entropy loss function. For a given training
                    example, the error $E = -\log(p_c)$ where $p_c$ is the
                    probability of the correct answer in the example. Note
                    that
                    <strong>while you will not directly use the loss for
                        training or updating your parameters in this
                        assignment, printing out the loss will be a very
                        valuable tool in debugging, and you will use the
                        loss to update your parameters in future
                        assignments</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should then fill out the
                    <code>gradient_descent</code> and
                    <code>backpropagation</code> functions.
                    <code>gradient_descent</code> is where you should be
                    calculating your gradients and returning them.
                    <code>backpropagation</code> is where you should be
                    applying your gradients with your negative learning rate 
                    (do not negate the weights and bias in backpropagation).
                    <strong>Do not apply your gradients in the backpropagation
                        function and make sure you are applying a NEGATIVE 
                        Learning Rate</strong>. Your calculation of your gradients should take batch
                    size into account by averaging the gradients, and then
                    using that average to update your parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly you&#39;ll want to fill out the
                    <code>accuracy</code> function. You&#39;ll need to
                    compare the classes your model predicted to the actual
                    labels. <em>Note</em>: You should
                    <strong>NOT</strong> edit the constructor of the Model
                    class to take in any arguments. As mentioned above,
                    everything should be initialized (hard coded) in the
                    constructor.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Hint: To improve the model&#39;s accuracy,
                            consider using a non-linear activation function.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="step-3-train-and-test">Step 3. Train and test</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Now you&#39;ll want to fill out the <code>train</code> /
                    <code>test</code> functions. In <code>train</code> use
                    <code>get_next_batch</code> to iterate through all of
                    the training examples, and use your model&#39;s
                    functions to calculate the gradients and descend them.
                    In <code>test</code> you can get the probabilities by
                    calling the model on the entire testing set at once and
                    then use the accuracy function to get the accuracy of
                    those probabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your last step should be to fill out
                        <code>main</code> in assignment.py. There you will
                        need to load in the data, create an instance of the
                        Model class, train your model, test your model&#39;s
                        accuracy, and visualize the results.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Now it&#39;s time for you to do some Deep Learning!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="visualizing-results">Visualizing Results</h2>
            <p>
                We provided the <code>visualize_loss(losses)</code> method
                for you to visualize how your loss changes after each batch
                using matplotlib, a useful Python library for plotting
                graphs.
                <strong><em>DO NOT EDIT THIS FUNCTION.</em></strong> You
                should call this function in train method after you store
                the loss per batch in an array, which would be passed into
                this function. This should plot a line graph where the
                horizontal axis is the i&#39;th batch and the vertical axis
                is the loss value of the batch.
            </p>
            <p>
                We&#39;ve also provided the
                <code>visualize_results(image_data, probabilities,
                        image_labels)</code>
                method for you to visualize your predictions against the
                true labels also using matplotlib. This method is currently
                written with the labels having a shape of [number of images,
                1].
                <strong><em>DO NOT EDIT THIS FUNCTION (unless your labels are
                        of shape [number of images, 10]).</em></strong>
                You should call this function after training and testing on
                a set of 10 test images, which you can get by calling
                get_next_batch(). This should result in a visual of 10
                images with your predictions and the actual label written
                above so you can compare your results! You should do this
                <strong>last</strong>, after you are sure you have met the
                benchmark for test accuracy.

                functionality. Your model should have an accuracy that is at
                least greater than 80% on the testing data.

                    While there is no strict time limit for the running
                    this assignment, it should less than a minute. If it

                <strong>We will test by running your Model class against our
                    test suite</strong>, where we provide the training and testing data. This
                means that your program has to be able to run without any

                files as global variables if they are in your local
                directory. To be clear, we will not be running your main
                function, but you should ensure that you have implemented
                your main function correctly such that it will produce the
                desired output.
                <strong>We will be running your train and preprocessing
