            <p>Blueno is exuberantly exploring the extravagant extraterrestrial event-horizons. Gazing at the gigantic
                grandiosity of the galaxies, Blueno gradually grasps their generally graph-like structure. He
                presumptuously portends that he could predicate the prior proclivities of each planet plan, but so
                painstaking is such a proposition. Aid Blueno in accurately assigning attributes to graphs according to

            <h3 id="dgl-resources">DGL Resources</h3>
            <p>DGL is a powerful library for graph representations, and it can be a little tricky to use for the first
                time! Here are some tips...</p>
            <p>1) DGL represents their graphs as a DGLGraph class, usually referred to in our code as <code>g</code>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nodes are represented as indices (e.g if you have ten nodes in your graph g , <code>g.nodes()</code>
                    will return <code>[0, 1, 2, ..., 9]</code>)</li>
                <li>Edges are represented as a tuple of <code>(src, dst)</code>. That is,
                    <code>([0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1])</code> represents a graph with an edge from node 0 to node 2, 1 to 2,
                    and 2 to 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We recommend you take a look at the DGL documentation for <a
                    href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/guide/graph-graphs-nodes-edges.html#guide-graph-graphs-nodes-edges">1.2
                    Graphs, Nodes, and Edges</a> for more information.</p>
            <p>2) Each node has features, which it carries via some attribute. This data will be the node vector that
                represents the current state of each node during message passing. You&#39;ll need to set data for each
                node before you do this message passing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For example, if you have 3 nodes and a tensor <code>t</code> containing node features
                    <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, you can set them all at the same time by saying
                    <code>g.ndata[&#39;node_feats&#39;] = t</code>. This will give node 0 the &quot;a&quot; tensor, 1
                    the &quot;b&quot; tensor, and 2 the &quot;c&quot; tensor, all queryable under &#39;node_feats&#39;.
                    You can think of <code>ndata</code> as a map storing all of the data for all the nodes under some
                    key. In this case, we set the key to &#39;node_feats&#39;.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>3) Once the <code>ndata</code> has been set, you&#39;re ready to start message passing. This is handled
                by calling <code>send_and_recv</code> on your graph with the appropriate arguments. In part 2, you will
                call send_and_recv from your own custom layer, and in part 3 you will use
                <code>dgl.DGLGraph.send_and_recv</code>. There is documentation here: <a
                    href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.send_and_recv.html">send_and_recv</a> and
                in the stencil.</p>
            <h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
            <p>One of the major baselines for networks that operate on graphs are the NCI datasets. These are datasets
                of molecules that have been annotated with binary labels marking them as either
                <em>&quot;active&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;inactive&quot;</em> against a certain kind of cancer
                (specifically, a variant of lung cancer). Note that in this dataset, the atoms and bonds between them
                are the nodes and edges, respectively. Likewise, each molecule itself is an undirected graph.</p>
            <p>Typically with a molecule dataset, we would expect the nodes (atoms) to have features, like
                mass/charge/position, as well as the edges, like the type of bond (single/double etc.). However, this
                dataset has no other information besides the types of atoms that exist and the bonds between them. This
                makes each molecule a sort of &quot;symbolic&quot; graph. This will make it a good baseline for the
                purposes of this assignment even though we&#39;re missing some of the features needed to get high
                accuracies.</p>
            <p>In order to classify a molecule (or any of its sub pieces, like certain nodes or edges) correctly, we
                must learn its structure properly. If we only encode, say, all the nodes into vectors and feed them
                through a feed-forward layer, we lose all of our information about how this graph is connected! To avoid
                this, you will implement a neural network that performs <strong>message passing</strong> among nodes,
                similar to how you&#39;ve seen in lecture.</p>
            <p>Our stencil provides a model class with several methods and hyperparameters you need to use for your
                network. You will also answer conceptual questions related to the assignment and class material.</p>
            <p>You should include a brief README with your model&#39;s accuracy and any known bugs.</p>
            <h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
            <h3 id="step-1-preprocessing">Step 1: Preprocessing</h3>
            <h4 id="preprocess-the-data">Preprocess the data</h4>
            <p>We will be using <code>1-balance.sdf</code> for training and testing.</p>
            <p>Reading sdf files is a major pain, so we&#39;ve written a parser for you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Call <code>read_file(file_name)</code> on the file name passed to <code>get_data</code>, and it will
                    return a list of molecules (see the stencil for more details).<ul>
                        <li>In essence, a molecule consists of:<ul>
                                <li>a list of nodes (each &quot;node&quot; is an atomic number of some element)</li>
                                <li>a list of edges (tuples of integers (i, j) representing a connection between nodes i
                                    and j)</li>
                                <li>a label of active or inactive against cancer (0 or 1).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>From here, you need to one-hot encode these nodes, shuffle the data, and return a training and
                    testing split of 0.9 to 0.1. Your nodes should be 2-D numpy arrays of size (number_of_atoms x 119)
                    (more details in stencil).</li>
                <li>Note that before calling <code>shuffle</code> you should call <code>seed(rd_seed)</code>. This is so
                    we can check the validity of your inputs with our own in our autograder. Make sure you are using the
                    <code>shuffle</code> and <code>seed</code> from Python&#39;s <code>random</code> module (these
                    should already be imported in the stencil). Do not use any sort of random sampling function to
                    generate your train/test split. <code>shuffle</code> should be the only source of randomness here.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="represent-it-as-a-dgl-graph">Represent it as a DGL Graph</h4>
            <p>In the <code>build_graph</code> method, you should instantiate a DGL Graph and add as many nodes as you
                have in your molecule. Then, add edges between all nodes. More details on how to set up these graphs can
                be found in the <a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/api/python/graph.html">DGL Graph
                    Documentation</a>. You should also turn the nodes of the molecule into a tensor and assign it as the
                initial node features of the graph. The stencil will have more information. You may also find the points
                in the &quot;DGL Resources&quot; section of this handout helpful.</p>
            <p>When you are to batching your molecules together in the <code>train</code> and <code>test</code>
                functions, you&#39;ll need to collect all of the graphs representing each molecule into a list, and then
                call <a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/generated/dgl.batch.html">dgl.batch</a> to turn them into a
                batched graph that you can perform message passing on as you would a smaller one.</p>
            <h3 id="step-2-implementing-message-passing">Step 2: Implementing Message Passing</h3>
            <p>In this section, you will write a basic MPNN with your own message passing algorithm. This message
                passing algorithm will be written in <code>custom_snr.py</code>. You will be responsible for writing the
                function <code>custom_send_and_recv</code> (in <code>custom_snr.py</code>). This will show you how MPNNs
                actually pass messages between nodes. In this function we pass in the message function and reducing
                function we would like you to use. Note that we will not be using <code>custom_send_and_recv</code> for
                training on our dataset since our send_and_recv implementations will be inefficient. To handle learning
                an MPNN on our NCI dataset, you will be able to replace your <code>custom_send_and_recv</code> function
                with the one from DGL, but you don&#39;t need to worry about that for this step.</p>
            <p>Your <code>custom_send_and_recv</code> should populate a mailbox with mappings from each node in the
                graph to mappings of message titles to messages (node -&gt; message_title -&gt; messages_of_that_title).
                It should then use each node&#39;s messages to compute an updated feature for that node.</p>
            <p>To check if your message passing implementation works, run <code>python3 custom_snr.py</code> in your
                command line. It will run the <code>run_tests</code> function in the <code>custom_snr.py</code> file and
                the visualizer.</p>
            <p>To learn more about how DGL handles sending and receiving messages, we recommend you read <a
                    href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/guide/message.html">Chapter 2: Message Passing</a> from the DGL
                documentation.</p>
            <p>Feel free to read the docs and test your implementation against the one from the DGL library (<a
                    href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/generated/dgl.DGLGraph.send_and_recv.html">dgl.DGLGraph.send_and_recv</a>)
                to get started.</p>
            <h3 id="step-3-the-model-with-dgl-message-passing-">Step 3: The Model (with DGL message passing)</h3>
            <p>You&#39;ll also notice that you have two classes to fill out this time: One for the <code>Model</code>
                itself, and one that&#39;s re-used quite a bit: The <code>MPLayer</code> (Message Passing Layer). This
                handles a single round of message passing in our network. We define it as a layer of sorts so that you
                can re-use it to perform many rounds of message passing.</p>
            <p>The overall architecture of your model should look like:</p>
            <p>1) After representing a batch of molecules as a graph, you want to use a single feed-forward layer as a
                lifting network to transform our node features from raw features (ie. the symbol of the atom) into a
                higher dimensional space where we will perform message passing.</p>
            <p>2) For each MPLayer, pass in the DGL graph. Within the MPLayer <code>call</code> function, either call
                your <code>custom_send_and_recv</code> or <code>g.send_and_recv</code> depending on the
                <code>is_testing</code> parameter (when <code>is_testing</code> is True you want to use your custom send
                and receive implementation). We give you <code>messager</code> and <code>reducer</code>, which are the
                two functions you want to pass into both send and receive functions. Then, pass the previous node
                features into a linear layer and store the results back into <code>ndata</code>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When computing a message from a node and its vector v1 to a node n2, use the message rule
                        <code>m = ReLU(f(v1))</code>, where f is a feed-forward layer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When aggregating messages at a node, just sum them all up and replace the node&#39;s vector with
                        the result (a la convolution)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>3) Back in the Model class, after ReLUing the output of your final MPLayer, you should feed the result
                into your readout function in order to &quot;classify&quot; the graph into logits. The readout function
                we request that you implement is a summation over all of the features after they have been fed through a
                neural network to reduce their dimensionality to 2. You can sum over a batched graph with <a
                    href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/generated/dgl.sum_nodes.html">dgl.sum_nodes</a>.</p>
            <p>MPNNs can be quite finicky, and the dataset is quite small, so our particular recommendation for
                architecture is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lifting layer of size (119, 300)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>3 MPLayers of size (300, 300)</p>
                </li>
                <li>

            <h3 id="step-4-train-test">Step 4: Train / Test</h3>
            <p>After reading in your data (<code>1-balance.sdf</code>), you should form a graph out of each of your
                molecules. You can then batch these into a graph, and run this through your model, which will return
                logits. Feed these logits and a batch of labels through the given loss function. Follow the steps in the
                stencil to update your weights correctly from this point. After training has completed for one epoch,
                print the testing accuracy on the test set.</p>
            <h2 id="visualizing-results">Visualizing Results</h2>
            <h3 id="visualizing-message-passing">Visualizing Message Passing</h3>
            <p>After testing your implementation of message passing, you can visualize it being performed on an
                arbitrary graph! You&#39;ll want to fill out the <code>run_visualize_message_passing</code> function (in
                <code>helper.py</code>) by constructing a graph and generating some node features to pass to the first
                round of messaging. In this function, you&#39;ll want to call <code>visualize_message_passing</code>,
                another helper function that animates your message passing function for a certain number of rounds. It
                takes in a number of optional parameters which affect the animation, the graph that&#39;s displayed, and
                the number of rounds of message passing.</p>
            <p>We recommend calling <code>run_visualize_message_passing</code> in the <code>main</code> function of
                <code>custom_snr.py</code>.</p>
            <p>Once you have the visualization working, feel free to play around with the <code>simple_message</code>
                function and the parameters of <code>visualize_message_passing</code> to get interesting results!</p>
            <p>The visualization is powered by <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> and <a
                    href="https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html">NetworkX</a>.</p>

            <p>Please complete the CS2470-only conceptual questions <strong>in addition</strong> to the coding
                assignment and the CS1470 conceptual questions.</p>
            <p><strong>Note: Questions about 2470 will only be answered on Piazza, or by TAs marked with an asterisk (*)

            <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
            <p><strong>Code:</strong> You will be primarily graded on functionality. As mentioned before, this symbolic
                graph lacks a lot of details that we&#39;d need to make really good predictions. Because of this, even
                <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/graph-classification-on-nci1">some novel papers</a> from the
                last few years struggle to get above 65-70% accuracy. <strong>You will get full points on the autograder
                    if you get above 65% testing accuracy after any epoch.</strong> Don&#39;t be worried about some
                variance in testing accuracy. Again due to the small size of the dataset, you should expect some
                fluctuation in your top accuracy. A correct model should always score above 65%, but you ought to see it
                break above 70 in many cases.</p>
            <p><strong>Conceptual:</strong> You will be primarily graded on correctness (when applicable),
                thoughtfulness, and clarity. </p>
            <h2 id="handing-in">Handing In</h2>
            <p>You should submit the assignment via Gradescope under the corresponding project assignment by zipping up
                your hw5 folder.</p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Please make sure your files are in &quot;hw5/code&quot;. This is very important for our
                        autograder to work!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>DELETE the data folder</strong> before you zip up your code; it might be too big to
                        upload to Gradescope.</p>
